# Is ICA open?

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1. It uses [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) to show if my local ICA store is open or not. Just for fun and learning a bit. For Yelp, you have to use your own credentials, change them in `main.component.ts`.

## Run Application

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
